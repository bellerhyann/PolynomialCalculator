Coded in Linux, on a PC

This C++ Program allows users to type polynomials into a terminal, and it will combine like terms using the order of operations. (2021)

BUGS
I am unsure what this program would do if an operator such as *, +,  or - would do if there were only one element within the stack. 
That is something I could have spent more time on fixing and fool proofing
SUMMERY
This project was straight forward and clean. The main errors I faced is I tried to use peek() 
instead of top() bu then later changed it. I am glad I tested the d and c button a little extra becaue i was able to fix a segmentation fault.
OTHER NOTES
I am very thankful for the provided polynomial class, 
I would like to get to the point were I can code programs with the same simplicity, 
and clean code that Blythe shows. I also want to work on writing code with better run times.
